Code for an iPadOS application to perform BA function through ceres solver is committed to the repository

The BA function through ceres solver utilizes the Levenberg-Marquardt technique for non linear optimization and the cost function is optimized for undistorted input provided by ARKit.

Will you kindly spare some time, I am yet to organize it though.
The app with the dependencies is built for iOS with the iPhoneOS SDK (version 17) for a target of iPad Pro (11 inch)(4th generation).
I've tried best to keep the footprint minimal.

Now I am continuing work on generating synthetic data and processing it in json format through the iPadOS APP.
